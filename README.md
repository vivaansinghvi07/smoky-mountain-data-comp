## Instructions / TODO
    - Everyone: Work on step 2

## Step 1 Process
    - Process the image to make it easiest to proces text (cropping, etc)
    - Plug those into a neural network to get the text
    - Get the text and process the text to make it match
    - Plug the text into the spreadsheet

## Notes
    - Vivaan:
        - [Synthetic data generation](https://github.com/Belval/TextRecognitionDataGenerator)
        - Font used in the labels was matched to be Sequel Sans Headline Medium
        - Create some images with varying background noises
