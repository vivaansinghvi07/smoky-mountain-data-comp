## Instructions / TODO
    - Vivaan: Use the software to generate training data for varruns and langas model
    - Varrun and Langa: Work coding a neural network model for the ocr
    - Chris and Pragya: Work on a function in sheet.py that takes in input and prints the row to google sheets

## Step 1 Process
    - Process the image to make it easiest to proces text (cropping, etc)
    - Plug those into a neural network to get the text
    - Get the text and process the text to make it match
    - Plug the text into the spreadsheet

## Notes
    - Vivaan:
        - [Synthetic data generation](https://github.com/Belval/TextRecognitionDataGenerator)
        - Font used in the labels was matched to be Sequel Sans Headline Medium
        - Create some images with varying background noises
