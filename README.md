# SMC Data Challenge

Code for our submission to the SMC Data Challenge #1, machine-learning apporaches to high-throughput phenotyping. View the solution paper [here](https://github.com/vivaansinghvi07/smoky-mountain-data-comp/blob/main/paper/main.pdf).

## Setup

If the repository is newly cloned, run `$ ./scripts/startup.sh`. See more information about scripts in the `scripts/` folder [here](https://github.com/vivaansinghvi07/smoky-mountain-data-comp/tree/main/scripts). Note: all scripts can only be run on a Unix-based system, not Windows.

## Getting the Dataset

If you have run the `startup.sh` script, you do not need to download the dataset this way.

Visit the link [here](https://labkey.ornl.gov:8443/labkey/CBI/Martin/PUBLIC_DATA/Davis_Common_Garden_Genotypes/project-begin.view?) and download the folder. Then, unzip the download, move the folder to this repository, and rename it to 'dataset'.

## Requirements

This project works with Python 3.9/3.10 (not tested with Python versions lower than 3.9). To install dependencies, run `$ ./scripts/venv.sh`.
