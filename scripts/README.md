# Scripts
These are terminal scripts that will assist in the use of this code. Note: These scripts are NOT supported in Windows CMD or Powershell. If you are on a Windows device, it is suggested you use [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). All scripts are written to be run in the home directory of the project (`smoky-mountain-data-comp/`).
