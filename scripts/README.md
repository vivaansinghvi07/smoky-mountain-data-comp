# Scripts
These are terminal scripts that will assist in the use of this code. All scripts are written to be run in the home directory of the project (`smoky-mountain-data-comp/`). If using Windows, it is preferred to run Windows Subsystem for Linux to use these scripts. Note: for these scripts, you will need `wget`, which is not installed on Windows by default. 

## Venv Scripts
`venv.sh` and `venv.bat` both run everything needed to set up the virtual environment for this project. You must be in the home directory of the project (the one with the `main.ipynb` file). To run them, follow these rules:
- If you are on a Unix-based system, run `venv.sh` using `$ . scripts/venv.sh`
- If you are on a Windows (Command Prompt or Powershell) system, run `$ .\scripts\venv.bat`
