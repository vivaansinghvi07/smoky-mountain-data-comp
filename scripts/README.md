# Scripts
These are terminal scripts that will assist in the use of this code.

## Venv Scripts
`venv.sh` and `venv.bat` both run everything needed to set up the virtual environment for this project. You must be in the home directory of the project (the one with the `main.ipynb` file). To run them, follow these rules:
- If you are on a Unix-based system, run `venv.sh` using `$ . scripts/venv.sh`
- If you are on a Windows (Command Prompt or Powershell) system, run `$ .\scripts\venv.bat`
